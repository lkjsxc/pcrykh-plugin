# Change control

This document describes how changes to the spec are introduced and tracked.

## Change framing

- Every change updates the relevant README and its local TOC.
- Structural changes reflow the directory tree to keep related concepts adjacent.
- Conflicts are logged before resolution details are added.

## Change records
