# Contradictions summary

Detected contradictions in prior revisions (now resolved):

- `achievement_id` vs `id` for achievement identifiers.
- `block_break` used in config examples but missing from criteria type list.

Current spec is consistent with these resolutions; no open contradictions remain.
