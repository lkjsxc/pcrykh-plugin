# Conflict resolutions

- node: docs/governance/conflicts/resolutions.md
	- C-006 — Achievement id field name:
		- conflict:
			- some data specs referenced `achievement_id`
			- runtime config and model require `id`
		- resolution:
			- the canonical field name is `id` everywhere
	- C-007 — Criteria type list vs config usage:
		- conflict:
			- config examples used `block_break`
			- criteria type list omitted `block_break`
		- resolution:
			- `block_break` is canonical and included in criteria types
	- C-008 — TOC canonicality vs README authority:
		- conflict:
			- README files were required to be the sole TOC
			- a rule declared that only items listed in the TOC are canonical, which excluded the README itself
		- resolution:
			- README files are canonical index nodes
			- canonical spec content is limited to paths listed in each README's TOC
	- C-009 — GUI scope exclusion vs GUI menu specification:
		- conflict:
			- scope declared GUI screens out-of-scope
			- GUI menu specification adds GUI behavior to the runtime
		- resolution:
			- GUI menus are in-scope
			- scope explicitly includes GUI menus for the achievement catalog
	- C-010 — Corrupted config schema blocks:
		- conflict:
			- runtime config schema block contained embedded spec text, making canonical JSON ambiguous
			- achievement pack schema block duplicated content inside a JSON block
		- resolution:
			- normalize schema blocks to valid JSON
			- remove embedded spec text from schema code fences
