# Change control

Rules:

- Changes MUST update both docs and source code.
- Breaking changes are allowed without migration.
- Backward compatibility is ignored.
- The canonical spec version MUST be updated in `config.json` on any spec change.
- Every change MUST be recorded in [change-records.md](change-records.md).
