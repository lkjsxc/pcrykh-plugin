# Achievements

This directory defines the achievement system, its tiers, criteria, and rewards.

## Core rules

- Achievements replace the entire skill system.
- Each achievement is an independent track with ordered tiers.
- Each tier defines exactly one objective.
- Achievements are grouped by category for UI and organization only.
