# Tier rules

## Tier progression

- Each tier defines exactly one objective.
- Progress is measured per player and per achievement.
- When a tier completes, progress resets to 0 for the next tier.

## Tier limits

- `max_tier` is the highest tier number for the achievement.
- If `next_tier > max_tier`, the achievement is MAX.
