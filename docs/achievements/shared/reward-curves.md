# Reward curves

This document defines default reward curves for achievements.

## Rule

- Even if a curve exists, every tier MUST list explicit reward values.

## Default curve (guidance)

For a 5-tier achievement:

- Tier 1: `ap=10`
- Tier 5: `ap=100`
- Intermediate tiers increase approximately linearly.

## Tuning

- Rewards MAY be overridden per achievement to match time-to-complete.
