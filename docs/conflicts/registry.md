# Conflict registry

This document collects contradictory requirements discovered across the spec.

## Active conflicts

- None.

## Resolved conflicts

- C-005 — Skills vs achievements (see [conflicts/resolutions.md](resolutions.md))

## Resolution protocol (normative)

1. Record the conflict here as soon as it is discovered.
2. Reference the conflicting pages and lines.
3. Declare which statement wins and why (precedence, update date, or explicit override).
4. Update the losing document to either:
   - Remove the conflict, or
   - Mark it as superseded and link back here.
