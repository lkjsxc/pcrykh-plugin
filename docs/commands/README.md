# Commands

This directory defines the full command surface. There is exactly one root command: `/pcrykh`.

## TOC

- [pcrykh.md](pcrykh.md)
- [permissions.md](permissions.md)
- [error-model.md](error-model.md)

## Command philosophy

- The GUI is primary; commands are for navigation, automation, and administration.
- Commands MUST be idempotent where reasonable.
