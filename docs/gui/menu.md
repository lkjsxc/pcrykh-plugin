# GUI menu

- node: docs/gui/menu.md
  - purpose:
    - provide a read-only view of the loaded achievement catalog
  - atmosphere:
    - menus MUST reflect a large-scale MMORPG ambiance
    - visual tone MUST feel ceremonial, luminous, and world-aligned
    - avoid casual or comedic styling
  - inventory:
    - size: 54 slots
    - title: `Pcrykh Achievements`
    - all clicks are cancelled; no item movement is permitted
  - content_layout:
    - slots `0..44` render achievements in ascending lexicographic order by `id`
    - if the catalog is empty, slot `22` contains a `BARRIER` named `No achievements loaded.` and all other slots are empty
  - item_rendering:
    - material is derived from `icon` using the platform match function
    - if the icon is invalid or unrecognized, use `PAPER`
    - display name is `title`
    - lore lines (in order):
      - `description`
      - `id: <id>`
      - `category: <category_id>`
