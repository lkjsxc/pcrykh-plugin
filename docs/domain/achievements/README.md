# Achievements

This directory defines the achievement system, its objectives, criteria, and rewards.

## System framing

- Achievements replace the entire skill system.
- Each achievement is an independent track with a single objective.
- Achievements are grouped by category for UI and organization only.

## TOC

- [definitions/README.md](definitions/README.md)
- [categories/README.md](categories/README.md)
