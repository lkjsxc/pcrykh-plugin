# Reward curves

This document defines default reward curves for achievements.

## Rule

- Even if a curve exists, every achievement MUST list explicit reward values.

## Default curve (guidance)

For single-objective achievements, rewards SHOULD scale with expected time-to-complete.

## Tuning

- Rewards MAY be overridden per achievement to match time-to-complete.
