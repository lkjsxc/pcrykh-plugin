# GUI

This directory defines the GUI system. The GUI targets a dense, polished RPG menu aesthetic (dense menus, polished item icons, clear navigation, satisfying feedback).

## Baseline GUI patterns

- GUIs are inventory-based.
- GUIs are navigable without typing.
- Each GUI includes:
  - A “Back” button (except main menu)
  - A “Close” button
  - A consistent footer layout
