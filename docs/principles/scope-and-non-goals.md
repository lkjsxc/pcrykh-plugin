# Scope and non-goals

## In scope

- An achievement-based RPG progression system.
- Achievement objectives implemented as **single, atomic goals**.
- XP awards for objective completion.
- A polished RPG-style GUI with dense menus and strong iconography.
- A single command surface rooted at `/pcrykh`.

## Explicit non-goals (for now)

- Level-up enhancements (stat multipliers, perks, talent trees).
- Backward compatibility with any pre-existing code or commands.
